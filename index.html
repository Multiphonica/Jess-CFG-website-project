    <h1>Tech Career Paths</h1>
    <p class=headingtext>So, your interest in the tech industry has been piqued! But what are the potential career paths you could take? Take a look at some of the many available areas here for some ideas!</p>
    </div> 

    <div class="frontendbox">
    <h2>Front-End Developer</h2>
    <p>Front-end developers do what you can see here - they design and create websites!</p>
    
    <h3>What skills do I need?</h3>
    <p>As a minimum, you need experience with <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">JavaScript</a>. You'll also use programs such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to host and share your code. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="backendbox">
    <h2>Back-End Developer</h2>
    <p>Back-end developers handle everything that goes on behind the scenes. They make programs do what the users need them to.</p>
    
    <h3>What skills do I need?</h3>
    <p>Experience with languages such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">PHP</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp">Java</a> is a great start to a back-end career.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fullstackbox">
    <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
    <p>If you just can't decide whether you prefer front or back-end, why not do both? This is what full-stack developers do - they make sure that the website, app or program does what it needs to, and design the front end that users see and interact with.</p>
        
    <h3>What skills do I need?</h3>
    <p>Experience with the languages listed above is a good place to start. There are also many other languages that you could look into, such as <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. There's a great diagram <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/blog/nine-best-programming-languages-to-learn">here</a> that shows the best programming languages to learn depending on what your career goals are.
    </div>

    <div class="machinebox">
    <h2>Machine Learning Developer</h2>
    <p>Machine learning engineers create and train programs and algorithms that learn automatically and can be left to run by themselves. Industries where you would find this kind of work might be the automotive industry, the translation industry and the finance industry.</p>
            
    <h3>What skills do I need?</h3>
    <p>As well as the programming languages listed above, you'll also need experience with data and statistical analysis.</p>
